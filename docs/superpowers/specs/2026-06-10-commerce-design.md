# Commerce (v1) — Design

**Date:** 2026-06-10
**Status:** Approved, ready for implementation plan
**Related:** Component Catalog v1 spec (deferred "ecommerce" — this is that work).
Dogfood target: hmc-cycling.org.

---

## Background

Ecommerce is the next clodsite capability. The dogfood site is
hmc-cycling.org — a working Eleventy + Worker store selling a small Printful
print-on-demand catalog via Stripe Checkout. The port is functionality-driven:
clodsite must **provide a way to sell a small catalog of products**. It does
not need to match hmc's current look and feel.

Selling has four moving parts, each addressed in this design:

1. Catalog display
2. Shopping cart
3. Checkout (Stripe)
4. Fulfillment (Printful for hmc, behind an abstraction that admits other
   fulfillment paths)

What hmc proves works at small scale: two-dimension variants (color × size),
flat per-product pricing, localStorage cart with build-time stale-item
purging, Stripe Checkout for payment + address collection, a webhook that
creates the fulfillment order, KV for webhook idempotency, and **size guides**
— a feature actual customers asked for, which is therefore a v1 requirement,
not a nice-to-have.

Clodsite precedents this design builds on:

- **`resend-form`** — components that ship a Pages Function
  (`function.template.js`), need secrets pushed at deploy, and provision cloud
  resources during deployment (Turnstile).
- **`theme_selector`** — site-level opt-in features in `build-plan.yaml` that
  change the rendered chrome, not just one page.
- **Builds are offline** — all network work happens at sync or deploy time,
  never at build time.

## Design

### 1. Data model: three tiers

Commerce introduces data that is neither human-curated nor build-generated:
provider-synced catalog data (variant IDs, mockup images, size charts). The
design keeps the inference boundary intact by giving it its own tier:

| Tier | File | Written by | Contains |
|---|---|---|---|
| Curated | `build-plan.yaml` | human/LLM | which products, display order, prices, provider choice |
| Synced | `$SITE/commerce/catalog.json` | `commerce-sync.sh` | normalized products: variants, fulfillment refs, size guides |
| Mirrored | `$SITE/commerce/assets/` | `commerce-sync.sh` | product images and size-guide diagrams, downloaded from the provider |
| Built | `$SITE/dist/` | `/build` | plan ⋈ catalog, joined deterministically offline |

`catalog.json` and `commerce/assets/` are **committed** to the sites repo.
Builds are reproducible from a checkout, product changes show up as reviewable
diffs, and the site never hotlinks provider CDNs (Printful image URLs churn).

### 2. `commerce:` block (site-level)

```yaml
commerce:
  enabled: true
  provider: printful        # selects the fulfillment provider module
  currency: usd
  checkout: stripe          # the only v1 value
  preview: true             # optional: cart works, checkout button disabled
  shipping:
    flat_rate_minor: 500    # integer minor units ($5.00); passed to Stripe Checkout
```

Like `theme_selector`, this is plan-level configuration that affects the
layout chrome (cart badge + drawer) and the deploy pipeline (secrets,
provisioning). When `commerce:` is absent, nothing commerce-related renders or
deploys — zero cost to non-store sites.

Three activation states, each a shippable milestone:

| State | Plan | Renders |
|---|---|---|
| Lookbook | no `checkout:` (or no `commerce:` at all) | products only — no cart, no buy buttons |
| Preview | `checkout: stripe` + `preview: true` | full cart chrome; checkout button disabled with "Coming soon" (hmc's `preview` flag, promoted into the plan) |
| Live | `checkout: stripe` | everything |

Cart chrome is injected whenever `checkout:` is present, independent of
`preview` — preview only disables the final button.

### 3. `catalog` component (page-level)

A standard catalog-anatomy component (`component.njk`, `component.css`,
`schema.json`):

```yaml
pages:
  - id: shop
    components:
      - type: hero
        ...
      - type: catalog
        products: [hmc-crow-tee, hmc-logo-tee]   # optional filter; default: all active
```

Renders per product: main image, front/back thumbnails, name, price,
description, variant pickers, size-guide trigger, Add to Cart (when checkout
is enabled). All styling via the 15-variable theme contract — any theme works.

**Variant UI is capped at two dimensions** in v1. Dimension 1 renders as
swatches when its values carry hex colors, otherwise as a dropdown; dimension
2 is a dropdown. The data model (ordered option dimensions, §6) is more
general than the UI; generalizing the UI is deferred.

### 4. Size guides

Customer-requested on hmc; v1 requirement, shipped with the display-only
catalog component (Phase 2). Normalized shape — N labeled tables instead of
Printful's two hardcoded ones:

```yaml
size_guide:
  unit: inches
  tables:
    - label: "Product measurements"
      note: "May vary by up to 2\" (5 cm)."
      diagram:
        image: commerce/assets/sg-tee-diagram.png
        steps:
          - { label: "A Length", text: "Place the end of the tape beside the collar..." }
          - { label: "B Width",  text: "Place the end of the tape at the seam..." }
      rows:
        - { label: "Length", values: { S: "25.5", M: "26", L: "27", XL: "28", 2XL: "28.5" } }
    - label: "Measure yourself"
      rows: [ ... ]
```

The component renders this as hmc does today: modal with one tab per table,
diagram + step descriptions, measurements table, variance note, values in the
stored unit (no in/cm toggle in v1).

Two rules fall out of normalization:

- **Providers normalize their own HTML at sync time.** Printful ships
  `<h6>`/`<p>` blobs with editor artifacts; the Printful sync module parses
  them into the structured `steps` shape. The component never renders raw
  provider HTML — the constrained-communication principle applied to the sync
  boundary.
- **Diagram images are mirrored** into `commerce/assets/` at sync time, like
  all provider images.

The shape is deliberately hand-authorable: a manual-provider merchant (or the
LLM, from a pasted chart) writes one table with a few rows. `schema.json`
validates hand-written and synced guides identically.

### 5. Shopping cart

Cart chrome (header badge, slide-out drawer, ~150 lines of client JS) is
**site-level layout injection**, not a component — it must appear on every
page. `render-templates.sh` injects it into the base layout when
`commerce.checkout` is set, the same way hmc's `layout.liquid` carries it.

Mechanics port from hmc unchanged:

- State in `localStorage`; item identity is the (slug, option-values) tuple.
- A build-time catalog set (every valid `slug:opt1:opt2` string) is embedded
  in the layout; on page load, cart items not in the set are silently purged.
  This prevents stale carts from breaking checkout after product changes.
- No server-side cart. The checkout payload is
  `{ items: [{ slug, optionValues, qty }] }` — **nothing else**. Prices and
  fulfillment refs never come from the client (§6); cached display prices in
  localStorage are cosmetic.

### 6. Checkout: Pages Function, Stripe-only

Two routes, rendered by `render-functions.sh` from function templates (the
`resend-form` pattern):

- `POST /api/checkout` — receives `{ items: [{ slug, optionValues, qty }] }`
  and resolves everything else **server-side** against catalog data embedded
  in the function at render time: each (slug, optionValues) → canonical
  variant, `fulfillment_ref`, and `price_minor`. Unknown combinations → 400.
  Creates the Stripe Checkout session (flat shipping, address collection on)
  with the resolved line items in session metadata, returns `{ url }`. The
  client can name products and quantities — never prices or provider
  identifiers.
- `POST /api/webhook` — verifies the Stripe signature, then runs an order
  **state machine** in KV keyed by the Stripe session ID. hmc's worker
  deliberately simplified this away ("we have the customer's money; a human
  sorts out fulfillment errors") — reasonable for launching one low-volume
  store, but clodsite would be turning that shortcut into reusable
  infrastructure, so v1 does it properly. The KV record is a JSON object,
  not a bare flag:

  ```
  ORDERS[session_id] = {
    state: "processing" | "completed" | "failed",
    attempts,                 // count across all webhook deliveries
    updated_at,               // ISO timestamp of the last transition
    last_error: { at, message, provider_detail }   // present after any failure
  }
  ```

  Transitions on each webhook delivery:

  ```
  completed               → 200, done (true duplicate)
  absent                  → write processing, call createOrder
  failed                  → write processing (attempts+1, history kept), retry createOrder
  processing, stale       → a prior attempt died mid-flight (crashed isolate);
                            treat as failed: write processing, retry createOrder
  processing, fresh       → another delivery is likely mid-flight; return 5xx
                            WITHOUT calling createOrder — Stripe retries later
  createOrder succeeds    → write completed, 200
  createOrder fails       → write failed + error details, return 5xx so Stripe retries
  ```

  "Stale" = `updated_at` older than a threshold comfortably above any
  possible fulfillment call (~10 minutes; webhook invocations live for
  seconds). Rules this encodes:

  - A paid order is marked `completed` **only after fulfillment succeeds**.
  - `failed` is always retryable — Stripe's retry schedule (hours to days)
    is the automated recovery mechanism, never silenced by an eager flag.
  - Failure details (`last_error`, `attempts`) are stored for operator
    diagnosis: when Stripe exhausts retries, the webhook failure shows in
    the Stripe dashboard and the KV record says exactly what went wrong and
    how many times. Human intervention remains the final tier — the hmc
    property, preserved, but now with automated recovery in front of it
    and diagnostics behind it.

  Because KV reads are eventually consistent, the state machine is
  best-effort dedup only; the **authoritative** duplicate guard is the
  provider idempotency key (§7): `createOrder` always receives the Stripe
  session ID and providers must dedupe on it, so even a double-fired
  fulfillment call cannot create a duplicate order.

Deploy pipeline additions, all following the Turnstile provision-or-reuse
pattern:

| Step | Pattern precedent |
|---|---|
| `provision-kv.sh` — ensure `ORDERS` KV namespace, bind to the Pages project | `provision-turnstile.sh` |
| `provision-stripe-webhook.sh` — create/reuse the webhook endpoint via Stripe API, capture the signing secret | `provision-turnstile.sh` |
| Push `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, provider secrets (e.g. `PRINTFUL_API_KEY`) | `RESEND_API_KEY` push in `deploy.sh` |

**Payment is not abstracted in v1.** Stripe only. The seam where a payment
abstraction would go is the checkout function; it stays visible and
recoverable. One abstraction at a time — fulfillment is the one this spec
commits to.

### 7. Fulfillment provider abstraction

A provider touches the system at exactly two moments, which defines the
interface:

```js
// sync time (local machine) — scripts/lib/commerce/providers/<name>/sync.mjs
export async function syncCatalog(config, env)
// → writes normalized catalog.json + mirrors images to commerce/assets/

// order time (deployed Pages Function) — scripts/lib/commerce/providers/<name>/order.mjs
export async function createOrder(order, env)
// order = { idempotency_key,            // Stripe session ID — providers MUST dedupe on it
//           lineItems: [{ fulfillment_ref, qty }], shipping, email }
// → { provider_order_id }
```

`idempotency_key` is the authoritative duplicate guard (the KV state machine
in §6 is best-effort): Printful sets it as the order `external_id` and treats
an existing order with that ID as success; manual passes it as the Resend
`Idempotency-Key` header.

Everything between those moments — display, cart, Stripe session, signature
verification, idempotency — is provider-agnostic.

Key properties:

- **`fulfillment_ref` is opaque and never leaves the server.** For Printful
  it's the variant ID. Nothing outside the provider's two modules interprets
  it, and it is never client-controlled: the browser sends only
  (slug, optionValues, qty); the checkout function resolves the ref from its
  embedded catalog data and writes it into Stripe session metadata
  server-side; the webhook reads it back from Stripe. The full path —
  catalog.json → checkout function → Stripe → webhook → `createOrder` — is
  server-to-server end to end.
- **A provider is two files** because its halves run in different worlds:
  `sync.mjs` runs locally under Node; `order.mjs` is bundled into the webhook
  function template at render time and runs on Cloudflare. This bundling step
  is the one genuinely new mechanism in the design.
- **Normalized product shape** (the `catalog.json` contract):

```
{ products: [{
    slug, name, description, price_minor, active,
    images: { main, gallery: [...] },          // local commerce/assets/ paths
    options: [{ name: "Color", values: [{ value: "White", hex: "#FFFFFF" }] },
              { name: "Size",  values: [{ value: "M" }] }],
    variants: [{ optionValues: { Color: "White", Size: "M" },
                 fulfillment_ref: "4938291" }],
    size_guide: { ... }                        // §4 shape, optional
} ] }
```

**v1 ships two providers** to prove the abstraction is real:

1. **`printful`** — the dogfood. `sync.mjs` ports `sync-products.js`
   (catalog + size-guide fetch + image mirroring); `order.mjs` ports the
   Printful half of hmc's worker.
2. **`manual`** — the degenerate case and likely the most common small-site
   need ("sell 3 things, fulfill them yourself"). No sync: `catalog.json` is
   hand- or LLM-authored and validated by schema. `createOrder` emails the
   order to the merchant via the existing Resend machinery.

If the interface survives both without leaking provider details, a third
provider (Shopify fulfillment, digital downloads) slots in later.

### 8. Validation

`validate-plan.mjs` grows commerce rules: `commerce.provider` must name a
known provider, `checkout: stripe` is the only accepted value, a `catalog`
component requires `commerce/catalog.json` to exist and validate, plan
product filters must reference catalog slugs, and all money fields
(`price_minor`, `flat_rate_minor`) must be non-negative integers. The catalog
component's `schema.json` validates the normalized product shape including
size guides.

**Money is integer minor currency units everywhere** — plan, catalog,
checkout function, provider interface (`price_minor: 2000` is $20.00 USD).
hmc's three coexisting representations (`20`, `"20.00"`, `2000`) are exactly
the bug class this kills: a decimal string reaching Stripe's
integer-cents API silently sells a $20 shirt for 20 cents. Conversion to
display strings happens once, at template render time, using the currency's
exponent; no other layer formats or parses money.

Provider sync modules are pure `.mjs` with fixture-based `*.test.mjs` beside
them (the established convention — `run-tests.sh` picks the glob up
automatically). Pipeline behavior (lookbook mode, cart injection, function
rendering, provisioning) is covered by the bash suite with stubbed CLIs, the
same way deploy/turnstile are tested today.

### 9. Surface summary

## Decisions

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Flat-rate shipping via Stripe Checkout, configured in the plan | Matches hmc today; live provider rates deferred. No `getShippingRates()` in the v1 provider interface |
| 2 | `catalog.json` + mirrored assets committed to the sites repo | Reproducible offline builds, reviewable product diffs, no provider-CDN hotlinks |
| 3 | Flat per-product pricing (one price across all variants) | hmc's deliberate simplification; per-variant pricing deferred |
| 4 | No inventory/stock tracking | Print-on-demand doesn't need it; manual merchants manage their own |
| 5 | Size guides ship in Phase 2 with the display component | Customer-requested on hmc; display-only feature with no checkout dependency |
| 6 | Stripe-only payments, no payment abstraction | One abstraction at a time; the seam stays visible |
| 7 | Variant UI capped at two dimensions | Data model is N-dimensional; UI generality deferred until a site needs it |
| 8 | All money is integer minor currency units (`price_minor`) | One representation everywhere; kills the decimal-string-to-Stripe unit bug (§8) |
| 9 | Client sends only (slug, optionValues, qty); server resolves prices and refs | Prices and provider identifiers are never client-controlled (§6) |
| 10 | Order state machine: `completed` only after fulfillment succeeds; failures stored with diagnostics and retried; provider idempotency key is authoritative | hmc deliberately simplified to "flag early, human fixes fulfillment" — fine for one low-volume store, wrong for reusable infrastructure. Automated recovery first, human intervention preserved as the final tier (§6, §7) |

---

## Phasing

Each phase is an independently PR-able block; phases 2–4 need no Printful
account (the `manual` provider carries the pipeline end-to-end first).
Phases 1–5 have shipped.

hmc-cycling.org is a functioning store, not the place to test-in-production
what is essentially a major rewrite — so the original single "dogfood
cutover" phase is replaced by a validation ladder (phases 6–11) that
escalates one risk dimension at a time: real keys, real money, a real port,
real personalization, the real store — and only then the real domain.

1. **Spec** — this document.
2. **`catalog` component, display-only** — lookbook mode, hand-written
   `catalog.json`, size guides included. No `commerce:` block needed.
3. **`commerce:` block + cart chrome** — localStorage cart, purge set,
   deployed with `preview: true` (checkout button disabled; §2 activation
   table) since the checkout function doesn't exist until Phase 4.
4. **Checkout + provisioning** — Stripe end-to-end with the `manual`
   provider; `provision-kv.sh`, `provision-stripe-webhook.sh`, secret pushes.
5. **`printful` provider + `commerce-sync.sh`** — sync, normalization, image
   mirroring; the abstraction's second data point.
6. **`.env` test isolation** — the bash missing-key deploy tests rely on
   `unset` plus a repo `.env` that happens to lack real keys; the first real
   `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`/`PRINTFUL_API_KEY` written to `.env` silently inverts
   them. Isolate the test harness from the developer `.env` *before* any
   real keys exist.
7. **clodsite-demo goes commercial** — first contact with production Stripe,
   Resend, and the provisioning scripts (everything to date has run against
   stubs). Manual provider, one $1 product: buy a treat for Anchovy the cat —
   he'll send you a picture (eventually, when he gets around to it). This
   phase also streamlines **Stripe test mode**: users must be able to
   exercise a store safely and confidently before going live, so easy
   test-mode setup is an adoption requirement, not a nicety.
8. **bbpp commerce design** — a design doc (like this one) for
   bigbeautifulpeaceprize.com's certificate commerce. Two sales points: the
   prize *awarder* may opt to send a physical certificate, and the prize
   *recipient's* notification email offers a printed copy of their prize.
   Both require **personalization** — an order references a specific
   certificate/recipient, which the v1 checkout payload
   (`{ slug, optionValues, qty }`) cannot carry. Settle the channel (e.g.
   Stripe Checkout custom fields → session metadata → provider order) and
   the fulfillment split (manual vs a Printful print product) before
   building.
9. **bbpp port + certificate commerce** — port the live site
   (github.com/nopolabs/bbpp) to clodsite, then implement the Phase 8
   design. A live but low-stakes sandbox for ironing out real ecommerce
   flows end to end before touching hmc.
10. **next-gen.hmc-cycling.org** — parallel build mirroring hmc-cycling.org
    with the `printful` provider against the real store, on its own Pages
    project and subdomain with its own Stripe webhook endpoint; the live
    site and its Worker are untouched. Soak behind `preview: true`, then one
    deliberate live purchase.
11. **Cutover** — repoint hmc-cycling.org via `/domain` to the soaked
    next-gen project, disconnect the old Pages git-integration build,
    decommission the standalone Worker and its Stripe webhook endpoint.
    Reversible by pointing the domain back.

Cutover cautions (Phase 11): the next-gen project provisions its own webhook
endpoint at its Pages Function path during Phase 10, so cutover deletes the
old Worker's endpoint rather than migrating it — there is no signing-secret
handoff. hmc loses push-to-deploy (deploys become `/build` + `/deploy`), an
accepted workflow change.

## Deferred

- Payment-processor abstraction (Stripe seam noted in §6)
- Per-variant pricing; inventory/stock
- Live provider shipping rates (`getShippingRates()`)
- Variant UI beyond two dimensions; in/cm unit toggle
- Digital goods / non-shipped fulfillment
- Multi-page product detail routes (catalog is single-page in v1, as on hmc)
